# This script is a clarified and criticised version of Trottefox's acclaimed "Two sigma
# playground" kernel (half train holdout 0.020876, pub LB 0.0149618).
# 
# (It may very well have a long history of forks before that and contributions by others,
# I did not follow the source trail; apologies if I ought to add credits.)
# 
# I (SK) am not really competing in this competition, but want to contribute my two cents
# this way. In my opinion the original script is (1) unnecessarily unclear due mostly to
# lack of comments and unfortunate variable naming, and (2) is methodologically unsound,
# reinventing many wheels but making them square, triangle, and elliptic instead of
# circular. This does a disservice to novices and as a result to our fine community.
# 
# One general thing to keep in mind here is that there is very low SNR in this problem,
# and it echos loudly in the evaluation metric (small changes to model can wildly change
# even the half-trainset validation score). On top of that, nonstationarity is a big
# issue, and so behavior in the second half of the trainset, the public leaderboard, and
# (supposedly) the private leaderboard is different. So do yourselves a big favor and
# don't take results in validation / public too seriously as predictors of the private
# score. The public ranking of this script will have much more to do with the correlation
# between competitors' solutions than its intrinsic quality. All that glitters is not
# gold.
# 
# All of this is not to say that the original script doesn't include several nice
# elementary ideas that are good to know and use. Let's just try to make them more
# accessible.
